    <!-- Active Shooter-->
    <div class="ActiveShooterContainer">
        <h2>Active Shooter</h2>
        <p>Active shooter situations are unpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the immediate deployment of law
            enforcement is required to stop the shooting and mitigate harm to victims. Because active shooter situations
            are often over within 10 to 15 minutes, before law enforcement arrives on the scene, individuals must be
            prepared both mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.</p>
        <h3>Remember to Run, Hide, Fight</h3>
        <h4>Run</h4>
        <p>Have an escape route and plan in mind. Leave your belongings behind. Keep your hands visible.</p>
        <h4>Hide</h4>
        <p>Hide in an area out of the shooter's view. Block entry to your hiding place and lock the doors. Silence your
            cell phone and/or pager. Silence will keep you hidden and safe.</p>
        <h4>Fight</h4>
        <p>As a last resort and only when your life is in imminent danger. Attempt to incapacitate the shooter. Act with
            physical aggression and throw items at the active shooter. Go all out. It's better to be injured because you
            pulled a muscle than dead.
            DO NOT CHARGE AT THEM. That's an easy ticket to death.</p>
        <h3>When Law Enforcement Arrives</h3>
        <p>Remain calm and follow instructions. Keep your hands visible at all times. Avoid making quick movements
            toward officers such as holding on to them for safety.</p>
