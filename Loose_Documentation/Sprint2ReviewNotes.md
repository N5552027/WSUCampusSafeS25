# Sprint 2 Report
Video Link: https://youtu.be/MOeLYz4p2Co 



## What's New (User Facing)
* Search Incidents (Currently using a .csv file to demonstrate)
* Contact Page
* Report Incident Page
* Feedback From Users Page



## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We created our feedback page, contact us page, and search incidents page. 
We also refactored a lot our old code to work with our database along with improving the User experience by polishing the User Inface. 



## Unfinished Work
The unfinished work is deciding the future of priority notifications and moving the current code in our javascript files to work with a singular backend
such that we can "hide" important things such as database keys/passwords and wrapping everything.


## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:
* Feedback Form
* Search Incident Reports
* Improved on the SubmitIncidentReports as well.


## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
* Notification System
A sprint one ordeal that we still had not finished due to figuring out how to structure our notifications and creating a suitable email account for it.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* We knocked out a lot of our front-end and our features which will allow us for sprint three to focus on working the backend of our project.

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Bug Testing our Searching Functions to work with incomplete reports (i.e missing fields in certain sections)

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Email notification
* Multi-Factor Authentication
