# Sprint 1 Report
Video Link: https://youtu.be/yEzlVO8FsDc


## What's New (User Facing)
* Created user stories to determine what features that we need. 
* Created Kanban Board to organize user stories and decided which user stories to implement in the upcoming two sprints.
* Set up Github for files.
* Created User Log in and Resource Access


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We worked together to create user stories that help us understand the major requirements of this program. We then determined which 
of said user stories are functional and non-funtional requirements. By doing this, this gave us the priority needed to implent said
features in upcoming sprints. We also began our user-login process and Email verification. 

## Unfinished Work
The features thatr will not be complete is the emergency alert notification. This is due to the fact that we need to consider how to set up the email within our backend. Furthermore, we are still learning how to use the crowcpp code to link our front-end to our backend. This would also be related to both log-in as well due to no linkage between front-end and backend. 


## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:
* [Safety Information](https://github.com/N5552027/WSUCampusSafeS25/issues/11)
* [Log-in Users](https://github.com/N5552027/WSUCampusSafeS25/issues/12)


## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
* [Report Incidents](https://github.com/N5552027/WSUCampusSafeS25/issues/2)
  Had trouble linking the front-end to the back-end using the same form code from log-in. Frontend implementation only.
  
* [Emailing of Emergency Alert Notifications](https://github.com/N5552027/WSUCampusSafeS25/issues/5)
  Determining how the email is sent to all users. Furthemore, our email notifications are hosted in our backend.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* We managed to get most of the front end to how we want it. It will just need to create backend code and .js code to link our frontend to our backend and database.
  
Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Our back-end code and linking it to our front end. This really hampered our ability to completely finish a lot of our issues that were created for this sprint. 

  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Organization and delegation of assignments.

Other meeting notes:
- swapping from C++ backend to node.js backend. (Firebase will 
- Swapping from .csv database to firebase database. 
- Executive Decision to host meetings Mondays and Wednesday weekly to catch up on code.
