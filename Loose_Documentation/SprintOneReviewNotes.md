features in upcoming sprints. We also began our user-login process. 

## Unfinished Work
The features thatr will not be complete is the emergency alert notification. This is due to the fact that we need to consider how to 
set up the email within our backend. Furthermore, we are still learning how to use the crowcpp code to link our front-end to our backend.
